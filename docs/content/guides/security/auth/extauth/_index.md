description: Authenticate and authorize requests to your services using Gloo's external auth service.

{{% notice note %}}
This section refers specifically to the **Gloo Enterprise** external auth server. If you are using the open source version of Gloo, please refer to the [Custom Auth section]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/custom_auth" >}}) of the security docs.
{{% /notice %}}

Gloo Enterprise provides a variety of authentication options to meet the needs of your environment. They range from supporting basic use cases to complex and fine grained secure access control. Architecturally, Gloo uses a dedicated auth server to verify the user credentials and determine their permissions. Gloo provides an auth server that can support several authN/Z implementations and also allows you to provide your auth server to implement custom logic.

While some authentication solutions, such as JWT verification, can occur directly in Envoy, many use cases are better served by an external service. Envoy supports an external auth filter, where it reaches out to another service to authenticate and authorize a request, as a general solution for handling a large number of auth use cases at scale. Gloo Enterprise comes with an external auth (Ext Auth) server that has built-in support for all standard authentication and authorization use cases, and a plugin framework for customization.

The graphic below can help provide context on how and when external authentication is evaluated when a request is received by Gloo and processed by Envoy relative to other security features.

### Implementations

We have seen how `AuthConfigs` can be used to define granular authentication configurations for `Virtual Services`. For a detailed overview of the authN/authZ models implemented by Gloo, check out the other guides:

### Switching Between Ext Auth Deployment Modes

By default, Gloo's built-in Auth Server deploys as a Kubernetes pod. To authenticate a request, Gloo needs to communicate with the authentication service over the network. In case you deem this overhead not to be acceptable for your use case, you can deploy the server in **sidecar mode**.

In this configuration, the Ext Auth server runs as an additional container inside the `gateway-proxy` pod(s) that run Gloo's Envoy instance(s), and communication with Envoy occurs via Unix Domain Sockets instead of TCP. This cuts out the overhead associated with the TCP protocol and can provide substantial performance benefits (40%+ in some benchmarks).

You can activate this mode by [installing Gloo with Helm]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise#installing-on-kubernetes-with-helm" >}}) and providing the following value overrides:

| option                                         | type | description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| global.extensions.extAuth.envoySidecar         | bool | Deploy ext-auth as a sidecar to Envoy instances. Communication occurs over Unix Domain Sockets instead of TCP. Default is `false` |
| global.extensions.extAuth.standaloneDeployment | bool | Deploy ext-auth as a standalone deployment. Communication occurs over TCP. Default is `true`                                      |

Note that you can provide any combination of values for these two overrides, including setting both to `true` if you'd like to more easily test the latency improvement gained by using the sidecar mode. Regardless of the deployment mode used, the values set in `global.extensions.extAuth` applies to both instances of Ext Auth.

You can set which auth server Envoy queries by updating your settings to use the proper Ext Auth upstream. On install, Gloo manually creates an upstream for each instance of Ext Auth that you have deployed; standalone deployments get an upstream named `extauth`, and sidecar deployments get an upstream named `extauth-sidecar`. If you are deploying both standalone and sidecar or just standalone, the default upstream name in your settings is `extauth`. If you are deploying just the sidecar, the default upstream name in your settings is `extauth-sidecar`.

Here is a look at a snippet of the `default` settings after a fresh install of Gloo, using the default Helm configuration; note the Ext Auth server ref specifically.

```shell
kubectl --namespace gloo-system get settings default --output yaml
```

### ExtAuth with mTLS

Production Gloo installations may require all communications between pods in a cluster to be encrypted; for most users, enabling [Gloo mTLS mode]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/tls/mtls" >}}) will be sufficient. When enabled, each container is deployed with an envoy sidecar that handles TLS connections.

While co-located on the same hardware, these Envoy sidecars do technically require an extra network "hop" and may increase latency. For users that require mTLS with very strict latency requirements, we added mTLS support to the Gloo extauth service itself. As of Gloo Enterprise 1.4.11+ (1.5.0-beta9+), users can use kubernetes tls secrets (e.g. created by `glooctl create secret tls`) with the extauth container by enabling native extauth mTLS with the `global.extensions.extAuth.tlsEnabled=true` helm value. To configure Gloo to look for the TLS secret, you will need to set the `global.extensions.extAuth.secretName` helm value to a secret that lives in the same namespace as extauth.

### Auth Configuration Overview

{{% notice info %}}
{{% extauth_version_info_note %}}
{{% /notice %}}

Authentication configuration is defined in {{< protobuf display="AuthConfig" name="enterprise.gloo.solo.io.AuthConfig" >}} resources. `AuthConfig`s are top-level resources, which means that if you are running in Kubernetes, they will be stored in a dedicated CRD. Here is an example of a simple `AuthConfig` CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: basic-auth
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - basicAuth:
      apr:
        users:
          user:
            hashedPassword: 14o4fMw/Pm2L34SvyyA2r.
            salt: 0adzfifo
      realm: gloo
```

The resource `spec` consists of an array of `configs` that will be executed in sequence when a request matches the `AuthConfig` (more on how requests are matched to `AuthConfigs` shortly). If any one of these "authentication steps" fails, the request will be denied. In most cases an `AuthConfig` will contain a single `config`.

#### Configuration Format

Once an `AuthConfig` is created, it can be used to authenticate your `Virtual Services` (or on the lower-level `Proxy` resources). You can define authentication configuration your Virtual Services at three different levels:

- on **VirtualHosts**,
- on **Routes**, and
- on **WeightedDestinations**.

The configuration format is the same in all three cases. It must be specified under the relevant `options` attribute (on Virtual Hosts, Routes, or Weighted Destinations) and can take one of two forms. The first is used to enable authentication and requires you to reference an existing `AuthConfig`. An example configuration of this kind follows:

```yaml
options:
  extauth:
    configRef:
      # references the example AuthConfig we defined earlier
      name: basic-auth
      namespace: gloo-system
```

In the case of a route or weighted destination, the top attribute would be named `options` as well.

The second form is used to disable authentication explicitly:

```yaml
options:
  extauth:
    disable: true
```

#### Inheritance Rules

By default, an `AuthConfig` defined on a `Virtual Service` attribute is inherited by all the child attribute:

- `AuthConfig`s defined on `VirtualHosts` are inherited by `Route`s and `WeightedDestination`s.
- `AuthConfig`s defined on `Route`s are inherited by `WeightedDestination`s.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

- if the child attribute defines an `AuthConfig`, or
- if the child explicitly disables authentication via the `disable: true` configuration.
